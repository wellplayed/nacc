# 3. Team Management and Roster Rules

## 3.1 Roster Size
Teams will be required to have six eligible players on its roster at all times.  There are no restrictions on position or designation of starter or substitute.

## 3.2 Roster Listing
The Active Roster will be displayed on an official competition website, to be shared publicly with teams. The Active Roster on that website will be updated upon proper filing of documentation. Once an acquisition is confirmed, the acquisition will be placed on the website. The Active Roster on that website will be considered the most up to date roster that could be applied within a reasonable time. Roster eligibility is still at the discretion of NACC officials.

## 3.3 Team Manager
Each team must also designate a Team Manager, who may be but does not need to be a player on the Active Roster. The Manager will be the primary point of contact for all NACC officials, and will also be the signatory authority for any documents which cause changes to the Active Roster, as outlined in Section 3.3 and 3.4. The manager must be identified before the start of the Series, and a successor must be immediately identified if the Manager leaves the team (for any reason). The manager must be fully eligible in accordance with Sections 1.2.3 and 1.3.

## 3.4 Manager Overrule
At the sole discretion of NACC officials, team managers may be overruled or replaced due to negligence, malice, or other reasonable suspicion of malfeasance.

## 3.5 Substitutes
Teams may freely play any 5 players from their roster at any time without any notification or approval process.

## 3.6 Acquisitions
A team may only acquire new players if a player is removed from their roster, per section 3.1.  Any new players must be fully eligible per Section 1.  If a team wishes to acquire a new player, that acquisition must be declared to a NACC official more than 3 full days before the game where the player would be utilized (e.g. if the next match is on Friday, a new player must be declared no later than Monday). NACC officials reserve the right to approve or deny any such request, based upon the eligibility of the players involved and the request’s compliance with the Rules.

## 3.7 Summoner Name Restrictions
For players who qualify for the Regular Season, Summoner Names and Team Names may not contain: vulgarities or obscenities; LoL champion derivatives or other similar character names; or derivatives of products or services that may create confusion.

## 3.8 Name Approval
All Team Tags, Team Names, and Summoner Names must be approved by NACC officials in advance of use in play. Unapproved name changes are not allowed under any circumstances. NACC officials have the ability to deny a team name if it does not reflect the standards sought by the NACC. A team or player will be notified by a NACC official if their name does not meet the standard, and the team will be allowed to change their name.  Players may not change their Summoner names on their main account during the season.

## 3.9 Sponsorships
A NACC team has the ability to acquire sponsors throughout the NACC season. Sponsorship acquisition is unrestricted. However, teams may not acquire “title sponsors,” as teams will solely be represented by their school name and a unique team logo without additional branding.

If the sponsor falls under the ensuing limited categories then the sponsorship may not be displayed by the players during the use or play of LoL, adjacent to LoL related material, the NACC, or any Riot-affiliated events. The NACC officials have the ability to update the category list at any time. The following is a nonexclusive list of limited sponsors:

 - **3.9.1** Gambling Websites:  defined as any website that aids or abets the wagering of funds on a sporting/esporting event and/or allows for the wagering of funds in casino games including poker.
 - **3.9.2** Non-“over-the-counter” drugs
